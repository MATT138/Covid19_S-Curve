# Covid19_S-Curve
Find best fitting parameters for S-Curve model by brute force approach to predict Covid-19 Cases (2020 Data)

This project was completed as part of the Computer Programming Course for the Information and Communication Engineering (ICE) Major at International School of Engineering (ISE) at Chulalongkorn University during the Academic year 2020.

In this project, we used the S-curve model to predict the number of COVID-19 cases using a brute-force approach. Some parameters in the model were fixed proportionally to the actual data to optimize the training time. Although this apporach is not the best for training the model in term of efficiency, it is very easy to implement.

This project couldn't be finished without the help of my project mate, Chantapat Lamsam and Nunthawat Pitisathianthanaporn
